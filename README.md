In the process of learning Rust (slowly ðŸ˜„)

As a student, I really enjoy the process of learning, not just about code, but about all kinds of subjects.
I started my degree having practically no coding experience, and I am proud to say that I have learned alot in only the past two years.
My current interests include gardening and embedded systems (weird combo I know). One day, I hope to land a software developer role, and something that allows me to work on systems level programs and/or embedded systems roles. I really enjoy the combination of software and hardware, so I am glad that I chose my schools interdisciplinary Computer Science and Engineering major.
Hopefully, the rest of my time as a student will lead me to greater things, and expanding my skillset so that I can achieve much on my own.

Some fun facts about me include that I have played the saxophone for about 8 years and the clarinet for about 4. 
I was in marching band in high school all 4 years, and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life!
Another fun fact about me, is that I am very interested in mycology. A friend and I used to grow gourmet mushrooms for fun (and to eat), and it was a very interesting experience.
