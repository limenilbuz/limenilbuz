# Emil Zublin's Github
## Computer Science and Engineering Student at the University of California, Irvine

My current skills include Python, C++, and VHDL.

Skills that I am learning right now include HTML/CSS, React.js and Verilog.

As a student, I really enjoy the process of learning, not just about code, but about all kinds of subjects.
I started my degree having practically no coding experience, and I am proud to say that I have learned alot in only the past two years.
Right now, my current goal is kind of fuzzy, but I think that I eventually want to end up doing research or at least working at some company that excites me.
Hopefully, the rest of my time as a student will lead me to greater things, and expanding my skillset so that I can achieve much on my own.

Some fun facts about me include that I have played the saxophone for about 8 years and the clarinet for about 4. 
I have tried to learn guitar *several times*, but I always seems to get lazy about it.
